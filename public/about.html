<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Ashwin S, a third-year Computer and Communication Engineering (CCE) student at Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology. I am passionate about integrating cutting-edge technology into healthcare, with a focus on developing automated systems for glucose level monitoring and ECG integration. I have worked on advanced topics such as Lamport's algorithm for distributed mutual exclusion and explored network protocols like NTP for physical clock synchronization.</p>

<p>In addition to healthcare technologies, I am expanding my knowledge in AI, particularly in using generative AI to simulate various conditions for training autonomous vehicles. I am currently doing a course in web development, and I am well-versed in Git and GitHub, proficient in commands like commit and branching. I am also enhancing my skills in Java, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Statistics. My aim is to apply my learning to develop innovative solutions that impact real-world challenges.</p>
